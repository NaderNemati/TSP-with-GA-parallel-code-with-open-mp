# Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm and OpenMP

Welcome to the **TSP with Genetic Algorithm Parallel Code using OpenMP** repository. This project embarks on a journey to conquer the renowned Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a complex challenge centered around identifying the optimal route that a salesperson must traverse to visit a set of cities while minimizing travel costs and overall distance traveled.

## Unveiling the Traveling Salesman Challenge

The crux of the Traveling Salesman Problem revolves around navigating the intricate network of cities, with the salesperson's objective of devising the shortest route. The challenge is to find an efficient solution that ensures each city is visited once and only once, while also minimizing the total distance traveled. This optimization conundrum serves as a classic benchmark for algorithmic prowess.

## Leveraging Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms, drawing inspiration from the mechanisms of natural selection and genetics, offer a compelling approach to addressing complex optimization problems. Operating on string structures analogous to biological entities, genetic algorithms evolve over generations through a process of survival of the fittest. In each iteration, new sets of solutions are crafted, borrowing traits from the most successful solutions of the previous generation.

## Harnessing the Power of OpenMP

Enter OpenMP—an Application Program Interface (API) jointly crafted by leading computer hardware and software vendors. OpenMP provides a portable and scalable framework, empowering developers to create shared memory parallel applications with ease. With support for languages like C/C++ and Fortran, OpenMP caters to diverse architectures and computational environments.

## The Confluence of Techniques

This repository encapsulates a robust solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem by ingeniously combining the prowess of genetic algorithms with the efficiency of OpenMP parallelization. The objective is to devise an optimized route for the salesperson while harnessing the power of parallel processing to expedite the solution-seeking process. The program has been meticulously crafted and parallelized to tackle TSP instances—more specifically, an undirected graph with ten nodes weighted by Euclidean distance.

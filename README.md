The traveling salesman problem
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is an algorithmic problem tasked with finding the shortest route between a set of points and locations that must be visited. In the problem statement, the points are the cities a salesperson might visit. The salesmanâ€˜s goal is to keep both the travel costs and the distance traveled as low as possible.

Genetic algorithm
Genetic algorithms are randomized search algorithms that have been developed in an effort to imitate the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics. Genetic algorithms operate on string structures, like biological structures, which are evolving in time according to the rule of survival of the fittest by using a randomized yet structured information exchange. Thus, in every generation, a new set of strings is created, using parts of the fittest members of the old set.

Open mp
OpenMP is an Application Program Interface (API), jointly defined by a group of major computer hardware and software vendors. OpenMP provides a portable, scalable model for developers of shared memory parallel applications. The API supports C/C++ and Fortran on a wide variety of architectures.

this code is about solving The traveling salesman problem by using genetic algorithm with openmp library . I tried to make a program and parallelize that coede.
I checked this code for a undirected graph with 10 nodes ang Weighted by Euclidean distance.
